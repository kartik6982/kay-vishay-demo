# Kay Vishay — Men’s Wear Retail Demo

This is a clickable demo for a premium retail software & digital showroom for "Kay Vishay". It includes a cinematic showroom, POS demo, inventory view and an admin dashboard.

Quick start (Windows):

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev (client + demo API)

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Client runs with Vite (default http://localhost:5173)
- Demo API runs at http://localhost:4000

Notes:
- This repo is a polished demo scaffold: use it to show flows (Collection → Enquiry → Billing → Inventory → Dashboard).
- For production-grade features (Postgres, Electron POS, auth), replace the mock server with a proper backend.
